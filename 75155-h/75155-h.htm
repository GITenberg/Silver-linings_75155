<i>SONG OF LOVELY THINGS</i>
</h3>

<p>
How many lovely things there be!
The ever-changing, restless sea;
the gracious, friendly, shady tree; and
children laughing in their glee.  How
many lovely things there are!  The
glowing, beaming, friendly star, the
garden gate that stands ajar, the sound
of Church bells from afar.  How many
lovely things I know!  Stories of lovers
long ago, and places where the lilies blow,
and children's voices sweet and low.
What lovely things have touched my
heart&mdash;see how the waves caress and
part, and watch pale Dawn from Night
upstart and slip into her mystic mart.
What lovely things my ears have heard:
the thrilling song of happy bird, a horse
by anxious lover spurred, a toddler's
sweetly lisped first word.  What lovely
things my eyes have seen: snow-covered
hills and fields of green, and silks of
wondrous weave and sheen&mdash;and Baby's
toothless smile serene!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap06"></a>
<i>TO ONE WHO SIGHED</i>
</h3>

<p>
You cannot sing?  Well, others
can.  You do not dance? but
others do.  And ever since the world
began there have been certain folk like
you who cannot dance, and cannot sing,
nor weave a play nor write a book.
But you can sew?  Most anything?
And are quite expert as a cook?  And
you can draw a little bit, amuse your
friends with pen and ink?  You make
folk laugh&mdash;this you admit.  You have
a lot of gifts, I think.  Oh, foolish one, to
sigh and fret because you're not as some
folk are.  Suppose a plant of mignonette
withered because 'twas not a star!  Be
what you are, dear girl, with pride.
Accept your limits with good grace; the
world is varied, very wide; for each of
us there is a place.  Within your sphere
be quite content, be proud of work that
is your own, and to life's complex
instrument with sweetness add your mite
of tone.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap07"></a>
<i>LOOK FORWARD</i>
</h3>

<p>
What a mess I made of things!
That was yesterday.  Yesterday
has taken wings&mdash;hide mistakes away.
Things I did can't be undone.  Silly
then to sorrow.  Better is the task begun
on a bright new morrow.  If I hadn't
acted thus!  Silence, puling heart.
Useless now to fume and fuss, make a brand
new start.  All the energy that goes into
senseless fretting would rebuild, if you
so chose, your plan in some new setting.
What a blow!  Fate is unkind.  Grit
your teeth, don't murmur.  Smile as if
you didn't mind, stand a little firmer.
Here is solace for your grief, nothing's
done beyond recall.  Smudged a page?
Well, turn a leaf.  Begin again.  That's
all.  Failed to-day?  To-day is past.
To-morrow's peeping round the door.
Never doubt you'll win at last.  That is
what to-morrow's for.
</p>

<i>THE WORLD'S BEAUTY</i>
</h3>

<p>
Not in seclusion is true beauty seen,
not in a fragrant, silent country
lane, nor in a daisy field all white and
green, nor in a golden meadow washed
with rain.  But in a smoky, noisy, busy
street, whose only colours through
shop-windows show; where there is constant
march of human feet that bravely journey
daily to and fro; where cripples play a
gay and daring air; and blind folk stand
and dream that it is light; where passers-by
who haven't much to spare yet stop
to give ungrudgingly their mite.  And
where small houses nestle close together,
beneath whose roofs hard-working people
live, who help each other in the stormy
weather, who have so little yet can always
give.  O beauty of the world, you are
seen best where the soul's banner floats
courageously above the turmoil of the
day's high-fevered quest&mdash;in ugly places
beautified by Love!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap09"></a>
<i>TO FATHER TIME</i>
</h3>

<p>
Whene'er you care to turn my
hair from brown to grey or white;
whene'er you line this face of mine with
wrinkles left and right, I shall not mind
nor call unkind these changes that you
bring; nor shall I pray for you to stay
your swift, relentless sting.  But Father
Time, please read this rhyme and grant
me this request.  Take not from me the
power to see a joke and merry jest.
Let me not tire of my desire to try
adventures new, nor e'er destroy my deep keen
joy in flowers of vivid hue.  Though
eyes grow dim and stiff each limb, please
leave untouched my heart.  So I will
heed another's need and act a friendly
part.  Pile on the years, give cause for
tears, but keep my courage strong.
Then come what may, I'll ease the day
with laughter and with song.  Do what
you will, you cannot kill my dreams, for
ever fair.  For they are mine, old Father
Time.  In them you have no share!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<a id="chap10"></a>
<i>MIRACLE OF SPRING</i>
</h3>

<p>
Were I to live a thousand years
I still would know that flaming
thrill, that rush of joy when first
appears&mdash;the golden daffodil.  A thousand
times my heart would sing when purple
irises unfold; or when forsythia's
branches bring their dazzling showers
of gold.  I could not see an almond tree
with branches all a rosy glow but that a
tide of ecstasy would through my being
flow.  Were I to see, a thousand times,
blue scilla bells amid green grass, I know
I'd hear their fairy chimes as I would
pass.  Were I to live a thousand years
I'd never watch the nesting birds except
through eyes bedimmed with tears, my
tongue bereft of words.  Were I to weave
ten thousand lays, knew I a thousand
songs to sing, I still would lack the power
to praise&mdash;the miracle of Spring.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap11"></a>
<i>EASTER THOUGHTS</i>
</h3>

<p>
Little growing things, pushing
through the earth, petals for soft
wings, bells to echo mirth.  Little bud
and leaf, spite of winter's pain, spite
of nature's grief, they are here again.
Little growing things, roots are in my
heart.  Hark! the robin sings.  Sorrow
must depart.  Doubts and chilly fears! winter
now is o'er, wipe away your tears.
Courage! rise once more.  Courage has
not fled, simply slept awhile.  Hope,
that you deemed dead, revived beneath
a smile.  Good cannot be slain, beauty
never dies, spring has come again, soul
of man, arise.  Arise and go forth now,
Easter calls to you.  Blossoms on the
bough, spirit burgeons, too.  The Lenten
lilies sing "From dead self, arise," while
every growing thing says, "Beauty
never dies."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap12"></a>
<i>SENSE OF HUMOUR</i>
</h3>

<p>
What it is, can't just say, only
know it saved the day, drove the
gathering clouds away.  Just a twinkle
in the eye, just a smile instead of sigh;
Lo! the storm soon passed right by&mdash;all
through a sense of humour.  What it is,
don't just know, but it made rich laughter
flow, life took on a rosy glow: troubles
shrank to half their size; sorrow wore a
cheerful guise; work appeared to be the
prize&mdash;all through a sense of humour.
Things were going very wrong, flowers no
colour, birds no song; weakness ousted
courage strong&mdash;stepped in a sense of
humour: put the balance right again,
saved two people lots of pain, brought the
sunshine after rain&mdash;and that's a sense
of humour.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap13"></a>
<i>TO A PETULANT HEART</i>
</h3>

<p>
Such a resentful voice&mdash;"I didn't
ask to be born," it said.  But being
here, 'tis fitting to rejoice.  In gratitude
lift up your voice.  "What for?" it
said.  For these and many things.  For
the flowers' gay hue; the bird that
sweetly sings, for grass bedecked with
sparkling dew, for being born an heir to
all the beauty that the world enfolds.
Come! have you not your share in sea
and sky, in hills and vales and wolds?
But more for this, oh, petulant heart.
That for your strength there is provided
toil.  And for your soul's sake, the
chance to do your part in planting fruitful
seeds in barren soil.  Oh, lad, oh, petulant
lad, cast off the foolish mood; be glad.
Be glad that there are battles you must
fight; and hills to climb; defeats to
suffer; goals to keep in sight.  Be glad,
yea, all the time.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<a id="chap14"></a>
<i>NEIGHBOUR JANE</i>
</h3>

<p>
Every morning, when she woke,
quaint and short the prayer she
spoke.  "Make me easy, Lord, I pray,
to live with&mdash;easy through the
day."  Nothing more did Jane e'er ask.  But
straightway faced the first hour's task.
Neighbours said it was a fact, Jane had
charm and Jane had tact.  She didn't
hurt nor irritate; she didn't prick, she
didn't grate.  Gentle, courteous, kindly
Jane, neighbours called and called again!
Found her presence like sweet balm,
sympathetic, soothing, calm.  "Jane,"
said one, "sweet oil has found to make
the wheels of life go round.  Bumpy
places disappear just as soon as Jane
draws near."  Every evening, e'er she
slept, to the window this Jane crept;
worshipped there the starry crowd.
"Who am I?" she cried aloud, "to
make a fussy, wordy riot when such
nobility is quiet!  Make me easy, Lord,
I pray, to live with&mdash;easy through the
day."
</p>

<a id="chap15"></a>
<i>DIMINISHING EVILS</i>
</h3>

<p>
How high those hills, how far away.
Menacing hills at break of day.
Friend, keep going; there's no knowing
when you will come to the end of the
way.  Be not alarmed, fear not at all;
at the foot of the slope the hill looks
small.  Journey along, hearty and strong,
the summit is reached e'er the shadows
fall.  How great those ills, grim foes
they seem.  Swift and swollen life's
angry stream.  Friend, keep going,
there's no knowing when troubles will
vanish as if in a dream.  Be not alarmed,
have no fear; the further away the worse
they appear.  Journey along, hearty and
strong; troubles are bubbles when
Courage is near.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap16"></a>
<i>THE DEATHLESS RAY</i>
</h3>

<p>
Oh!  Happiness, that bright, winged
ray, went darting blithely on its
way.  It made a little baby smile, and
then it skipped another mile, and made
a busy mother sing; and then again it
took to wing and darted swiftly to a boy,
filling his heart with youthful joy.  From
thence, a weary man it found.  To
sorrow he'd been straitly bound; but
suddenly his heart felt light and all the
world was fair and bright.  It darted
further; here and there&mdash;around the
world&mdash;just everywhere!  Right through
a thousand hearts it went, and yet its
strength was never spent.  This is a
truth we should remember, through all
the months, right to December, and
then the cycle round again: a ray of
joy need never wane.  Our happiness
we need not save; the store will last us
to the grave.  Give joy away; it will
return.  A lovely lesson this to learn.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap17"></a>
<i>LITTLE HEARTBREAK</i>
</h3>

<p>
A little Heartbreak, wan and sore,
was sitting by herself.  A sunbeam
slipped around the door and danced upon
a shelf.  Though little Heartbreak knew
not why, she ceased, quite suddenly, to
cry.  Still little Heartbreak sat alone.
"I never will be whole again," thus said
she in her saddest tone, "I never will be
healed of pain."  Then, unannounced, a
little breeze that had been playing in the
trees, passed softly over Heartbreak's
face, and, lo! of tears there was no trace.
Then when a bird began to sing, and
Heartbreak couldn't help but hear, there
happened such a curious thing&mdash;a silvern
echo did appear, enthroned itself in
Heartbreak's breast and, like the bird,
sang with sweet zest!  So little Heartbreak
tossed her head and laughed to
find the world so fair.  "It's true," she
cried, "my heart has bled, and I have
lived with black despair.  But I can't
be quite broken, long&mdash;with sunbeams,
zephyrs, and birds' song!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<a id="chap18"></a>
<i>THIS WAY PASSED HEROES</i>
</h3>

<p>
They passed but once this way, but
they have left a flowered trail
behind.  Surprising how in life's brief
day they found so many chances to be
kind.  They passed but once&mdash;this way
they went, and with them joy and grief,
and work and play.  There is no need to
raise a monument to heroes such as they.
They once were found in simple homes
and small, in offices and shops, engaged
in work.  They heard quite clearly Duty's
trumpet call, and forth they marched with
no attempt to shirk.  Soldiers were they,
no medals on their breast, a broom for
weapon, or an office pen; and victory
oft crowned the spirit's quest.  All
honour to these womenfolk and men.  They
were so gentle journeying the road, they
scattered little acts of kindness here and
there.  They had their burdens, but a
brother's load was also one in which they
wished to share.  No wonder we can see
the path they chose, for flowers have
blossomed everywhere they trod.  They
passed, and now through them there
grows a lasting symbol of the living God.
</p>

<a id="chap19"></a>
<i>JUST AS EASY</i>
</h3>

<p>
No harder to praise than to scorn, no
harder to love than to hate; no
harder to sing than to mourn, as easy to
act as to wait.  No harder to smile than
to frown.  It's as easy to stand as to
lean, as easy to lift as pull down, to be
generous rather than mean.  It's not
very hard to be glad, it's not very hard
to rejoice, it's harder indeed to be sad.
Let happiness then be our choice.  No
harder to trust than to doubt, and
courage is easy as fear, and foes are quite
easy to rout with weapons of Good Sense
and Cheer.  No harder to sing than to
cry, as easy to do as to plan; no harder
to laugh than to sigh, and gulfs aren't
to dread but to span.  And giving is
easier, too, than withholding your hand
from a friend; no harder to aid than to
rue&mdash;and sweeter the day at the end.

Oh, little wakeful tree, how beautiful
art thou, curving so gracefully each
pink blossomed bough.  Thou child, in
dainty party dress, to think that thou
wouldst brave&mdash;to give us mortals
happiness&mdash;a wind-blown, frost-lined grave!
Oh, little wakeful one, why didst thou
stir so soon?  The Spring has scarce
begun, thou wouldst have graced fair
June.  Thy blossoms will ne'er see thy
prophecies come true, nor summer's
pageantry with happy blushes view.  Pink
petals soon will fall (oh, little tree, be
still); soon will the thrushes call and
Spring trip o'er the hill.  Bare will thy
branches be, thy day of beauty o'er, but
little wakeful tree, we will but love thee
more&mdash;that thou didst dare to sing:
"Oh, heart, prepare for Spring!"

<p>
On the grass the sunlight falls, near
at hand a blackbird calls; a squirrel
races up a tree.  All this, and more,
engrosses me.  "Throw a stick," pants
Michael.  Such a gentle breeze now
passes; how graceful are the bending
grasses.  Here and there the children
play; I could sit and dream all day.
"Throw a stick," pants Michael.  Peace
and quiet and sweet repose; someone
has a cold, wet nose; something scratches
at my knees (lovely sun and gentle
breeze).  "Throw a stick," pants
Michael.  Michael's head is on one side,
Michael's mouth is opened wide; brown
eyes look beseechingly.  Michael! take
your eyes from me.  "Throw a stick,"
pants Michael.  Who can sit in selfish
ease, just admiring grass and trees,
deeming life most kind and sweet, when
a branch lies at one's feet&mdash;"Throw a
stick," pants Michael.

<i>RAINY DAY</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Rainy day," said Mother Dawn,
"rise from out your cloud-lined
bed.  Look upon each field and lawn, a
coverlet of mist I've spread."  Rainy
Day slipped from her cloud, shook bright
rain-drops from her hair.  As they fell,
she laughed aloud, "Mother Dawn, what
shall I wear?"  "Take, my child, this
dress of grey, fashioned from a frowning
sky.  Rainy Day, now run away, the
patient, panting earth is dry."  Rainy
Day played hide-and-seek, in and out
among the flowers.  Cooled a hollyhock's
hot cheek with her gift of gentle showers.
Red roofs shone with great delight when
she touched them for a space.  Dry
leaves trembled with delight, pressed
against her loving face.  Suddenly, a
flashing gem, heralded from mighty sun,
settled on the grey gown's hem&mdash;Rainy
Day her work had done.

No! little, whining, fretting care,
you cannot come a walk with me.
So lovely is the morning air I do not want
your company.  Oh! little, whining,
fretting care, you have no part in graceful

you have no kinship with a breeze.  I'm
going to a shady place where little children
laugh and play.  You'd cast a shadow
on each face if you came out with me
to-day.  I'm going where a little stream
bears lovely lilies on its breast.  I could
not sit awhile to dream if you're to be
my morning guest.  I'm going where the
poppies blow among the friendly golden
corn.  No little care would dare to go and

Back and forth; one and two; a

Filmy stuff of palest blue, bit of heaven
come to earth!  Anyone can visit Spain,
Holland, France, or Italy, if she cares to
go by train, if she cares to go by sea.
Back and forth; soft and slow, needle
dancing merrily.  Always thought I'd
like to go where grows the giant banyan
tree.  Needle's speeding down one side,
India's moon is very bright.  How
delightful thus to glide across a pool of
silver light.  Scented is the midnight
air, romance grows on every stem!
Jungle beasts for fights prepare&mdash;finished
is the wee skirt's hem.  Back and forth;
not too fast, on the way to Fancy's land.
Here we are, on shore at last, fairies take
me by the hand.  Back and forth, one

<p>
Proud trunk indeed!  It looked at
me with ill-disguised antipathy.  It
seemed to know I'd never been to all
the places it had seen.  I circled it with
humble tread and, filled with awe, its
labels read.  One year, I saw, it went
to Spain; and liked it, for it went again.
And once to Venice, once to Rome.  I
wondered if it longed for home.  I must
admit it travelled far; for there were
labels "C.P.R."  This trunk showed
such a haughty face.  I hastened to
another place, and soon a battered box
I spied that did not look so dignified,
and on its shabby lid there sat a whistling
boy with ball and bat.  Said I (my
manners are so bad), "Where are you
going, whistling lad?"  His smile was
wonderful to see.  "To jolly Margate
sands," cried he.  Back to the haughty
trunk I went.  "Each one," I bowed,
"to his own bent.  Though you prefer
some far-off land, had I the choice, please
understand, a shabby box I'd rather be,
with whistling lad for company!"

Poor old Robinson Crusoe, a lonely
man was he, with not a soul but
Friday to keep him company.  So when
I'm feeling lonely, humble, sad and meek,
I just remember that for friends I have a
whole good week!  Six days as well as
Friday, companions brave and strong;
it really seems they all deserve a tribute
and a song.  So here's to good Man
Friday, and to his brothers six.  There's
always one to help me should I be in a fix.
Suppose that Monday's greyish&mdash;there's
Tuesday coming soon, and if the morning's
boresome&mdash;there is the afternoon!  A
toast, then, to "a whole week" which
has such friendly ways, for should one
Friday disappear&mdash;it sends six other
days.

<i>A PRAYER IN ADVERSITY</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Lord, keep Thou my temper
sweet."  Thus I used to hear her
say as she trod life's lonely way, faced
so often by defeat.  "Lord, keep Thou
my temper sweet."  Phrase of wisdom!
How it clings.  Troubles now I never
meet, but within my heart there rings,
"Lord, keep Thou my temper sweet."  Sullen
is the storm-swept sky.  Everything
is going wrong.  That's no reason
you or I should broadcast a bitter song.
The world has quite enough to bear; we
at least might try to smile.  Adding
grief would be unfair, things will brighten
in a while.  Though despair is looming
near, let not bitterness hold sway;
now's the time to conquer fear, to-morrow
brings a happy day.  Sulk not with life
when things go wrong.  What though
you met grim defeat!  Chant this
helpful little song: "Lord, keep Thou my
temper sweet."

<i>THE WATCHFUL TONGUE</i>
</h3>

<p>
The "watchful" tongue I do
despise, the tongue that always
waits to learn what words would be
accounted wise.  'Tis such a tongue I
spurn.  The tongue that plays the suavest
airs upon the most expedient string;
that echoes much, but never dares to be
the leader in the ring; that always drops
a pleasing word because it's easiest so to
do; when drums of argument are heard,
by silence, sees the matter through.
Oh! I dislike the trembling tongue that
is afraid of words sincere.  I do detest
the song that's sung to the accompaniment
of fear.  And there's a silence I
abhor; a silence meant to lead astray;
a silence like a heavy door denying Truth
the right of way.  I'd rather hear quick
hammer blows, words edged with steel,
perhaps unkind; a muffled tongue, it
never shows the true complexion of
the mind.

<i>PETITION</i>

<p>
O Lord, I pray that I may e'er
delight in springtime's fairy
blossoms pink and white, in green and
lacy leaves; may never lose the joy
that always springs at sight of all the
little daily things&mdash;of brightly-patterned
weaves; of gaily-coloured china; rich,
dark grains that glow long after
daylight wanes, wood of time-burnished
hue.  And joy in sounds&mdash;the blackbird's
thrilling call, the human voice letting rich
phrases fall, all precious gifts from You.
O Lord, I pray that I may face each task
and rise to its demands, nor ever ask that
others bear my load; that I may prove
a loyal and helpful friend before I reach
the journey's quiet end along the winding
road.

was turned to night.  Someone was
caused unnecessary pain, and it takes
time e'er wounds are healed again.  A
little thoughtless phrase dropped like a
leaf&mdash;yet someone heard and, through it,
suffered grief.  A little thoughtlessness;
the mere not doing of some small act we
might have done so well.  Perhaps e'er
long we shall be sorely ruing this slight
omission more than words can tell.  The
things we do not do!  Ah, this is true,
they often hurt far more than what we
do.  A little thoughtlessness, or little
thought; between these two what differences
are wrought!  A little thought for
others, word or act&mdash;a cheery smile or
letter writ with tact, a putting of ourselves
where others stand, the understanding
heart, the helping hand.  The "I
remember," not, "Oh, I forgot"&mdash;a little
thoughtfulness has helped a lot.

Strong, I pray Thee, balanced, sane;
normal body, normal brain.  I would be,
if I might choose, somewhat witty to
amuse; somewhat clever to achieve;
somewhat capable to grieve; somewhat
kind to offer balm; somewhat like a
quiet psalm; somewhat fiery when need
be; ever quick with sympathy; not too
good, nor yet too bad; often happy,
sometimes sad; just a normal, decent
friend, courage-girt unto the end!  Not

can with ease, find, wherever she may

<i>LIFE, THE TEACHER</i>

<p>
Here is a truth the years have
slowly taught me.  There's not an
effort ever made in vain; though fate
within its painful clutch has caught me,
farther along the road I've gone&mdash;through
pain.  Here is a lesson life has slowly
taught me: to chase good Fortune is
young folly's way.  Always I've found
that she herself has sought me when
love of work alone has filled my day.
There's not a fault that I have e'er
committed, there's no mistake that I have
ever made, that has not into life's mosaic
fitted; this is a law that ever is obeyed.
There's not a thread I've used, though it
be knotted, but has in my life's pattern
found its place.  There's not a page,
though with mistakes it's blotted, that
does not show of destiny some trace.
Here is a truth that I have grown to
cherish: no righteous battle's ever fought
in vain; nor does a thought or deed of
goodness perish, but, like a tree, brings
forth its fruit again.

Next time we're in some trouble, almost

kettle, and a little song begin.  It helps,
when feelings are boiling, to let off lots
of steam.  Whistle and sing with
courage; things aren't as black as they
seem.  Kettle, you merry creature,
scorched by the callous fire, teach us
your power of moulding the will to the
day's desire.  Up to your neck in
troubles?  They haven't swept over
your head!  Sing like the steaming
kettle, till all your troubles have fled.
Singing will sound so pleasant to any

<i>HARVESTING</i>

<p>
Now when I went a-harvesting
across a golden field, "Turn back,"
they said, "this wheat and rye is not for
you," I did not sigh.  I did not flinch,
I did but sing, when I went forth
a-harvesting!  Within this golden field
(sang I) I've come by right a-harvesting.
And from (cried I) this fruitful field, I'll
take my proper share of yield.  I will
not sleep until I reap a goodly harvest
that will last until the winter's come and
passed.  I snapped my fingers while
they frowned.  I then began to bind up
sheaves of sunlight poured upon the
ground; of shadows made by dancing
leaves.  I took a blackbird's sweetest
trill; I gathered in a thrush's song;
where'er I went I gleaned at will; this
harvest does to me belong.  They had
no power to say me nay; the beauty of
the earth I own; a harvest song I'll sing
to-day in praise of fields that Joy has
sown.

<i>A PAEAN TO WORK</i>

To work!  Hour by hour, day by

brain.  To strive; to win an inch along
the way; to lose; to start again.  Oh! it
is joy to work unceasingly with might
and main.  Hard work is not a burden,
ever.  The busy ones are enviable indeed.
They have no time for petty ills that
sever the power to do, from the insistent
need.  That little leisure snatched for a
respite, how packed it is with joy and
keen delight.  Gold cannot buy it.  'Tis
reserved for those who labour through
the day until its close.  Work does not
irk.  It brings relief; assuages grief;
increases pleasure; adds to the measure
of any happiness we find; and brings to
the mind a peaceful satisfaction; to the
heart, a glow.  Oh! work!  You are the
kindest friend we know.

as she works at this or that she'll see a
smiling, winsome face beneath the
nearly-finished hat, that soon will have such
style and grace&mdash;an unknown girl's
delighted face.  Nice work a milliner's
must be, to make a jaunty little crown,
and trim it very prettily to match a
new and saucy gown.  For as the hat

The joy of coming down the stairs,
seeing loved faces once again;
familiar objects, pictures, chairs, a tree
that taps the window-pane; and books
that say, "We've missed the touch of
one who always loved us much."  The
childish, secret, but keen pride that hands
have grown so thin and white.  They look
so pale, so dignified; 'tis strange, but
true, this gives delight!  Then languor
and the wish to sleep.  Absurd, but one
would like to weep.  The lack of power
to concentrate, the feeling there's no soul
to care how hard the blow, how ill the
fate that one is called upon to bear.  The
weariness when friends forget one doesn't
wish for chatter yet.  The question,
"Will I e'er get well?" that's like a
thumb-screw and a rack; a deep depression
for a spell; then lo! the tide of
health flows back.  These feelings come

"Do you cherish hatred?  Of whom? and

maid unnecessary, increased work.  She
keeps her room quite spick and span, is
always punctual, talks with ease, falls

herself quite well, she writes her letters,

a spell to give her time for her own needs.

and hostess both agree when speaking of
their absent friend, a very perfect guest
was she.

<i>JUST GROWING-PAINS</i>
</h3>

<p>
Just growing-pains that made him
say that hurtful, bitter thing to-day.
He didn't mean to give you pain.  'Twas
just a storm that swept his brain and
made him argue black was white; and
bad was good, and wrong was right, and
made him scoff and made him sneer at
all the things you hold most dear.  He
isn't bad, that boy of yours, but just like
others, scores and scores.  First babyhood,
then childhood wanes, and then,
there come those growing-pains!  Oh!
Foolish parents to believe he likes to
make you fret and grieve.  The minute
that the word had leapt from his hot
tongue he could have wept, he felt
ashamed, too proud, alack! to take the
silly statement back.  He is a man (and
you should know it!) and loves you much,
but cannot show it.  He has to quote
from Bernard Shaw, and rant about life's
highest law, and say religion's out of
date, and reconstruct the Church and
State.  Soon will this phase grow weak
and wane&mdash;it's nothing but a growing-pain.

<i>A MAN</i>
</h3>

<p>
Successful?  Yes, through honest
work, not through some happy turn
of fate.  Never has he been known to
shirk since he attained to man's estate.
Approached each task with buoyant zest,
of all life's gifts deemed work the best.
But this alone does not portray the man
that I would have you see.  A zest for
work, I hear you say, is not a claim on
sympathy.  So other virtues I'll outline
which well describe this friend of mine.
He has that questing type of mind that
one associates with youth.  T'wards
fulsomeness he's deaf and blind; abhors a
lie, respects the truth; and honesty is
part of him, as much a part as any limb.
Quite perfect, then?  Oh! no, indeed.
Did I not say he was a man?  But turn
to him when you're in need and he will
help you all he can.  A loyal, sincere,
and upright friend, whom one can trust
right to the end.

<i>TO A CHILD BLOWING BUBBLES</i>
</h3>

<p>
Just with a little pipe of clay, a bowl
of water and some soap, you find your
happiness to-day, releasing fairy worlds
of hope.  Now watch these iridescent
balls sailing so lightly and so high, and
some collide with chairs and walls, and
then to beauty it's "Good-bye!"  You
do not weep, but blow and blow until
another doth appear, then wave your
small hand to and fro&mdash;it floats towards
the chandelier.  I watch your velvet
cheeks puff out, your lovely eyes are
shining bright.  I thrill to hear your
happy shout, "This one will reach a
star to-night."  Dear little child, in later
years may you make beauty with such
ease; and fashion, out of smiles and tears,
rainbows of glowing hope like these.
And should one bubble's fate be ill, then,
from your pipe of dreams, I pray you'll
blow another, laughing still, as you are
doing, dear, to-day.

<i>THE ANTIQUE SHOP</i>
</h3>

<p>
There is a little antique store, just
round the corner on Life's road;
and paved with tear-drops is its floor, and
smiles light up this small abode.  And
Memory sits there every day; she is the
guardian of these wares.  My heart, it
often wends that way, to see this shop
and how it fares.  My heart peers through
the window-pane with eyes like pools of
smiles and tears, so glad and sad to see
again the curios of bygone years.  Says
Memory, "O heart, draw near!  Here is
a little shining dream, and here a rippling
song of cheer; and here, your childhood's
fairy stream."  An antique shop this
Past of mine; its gems kept safe by
Memory; each kind word heard, how
they do shine, set in rare Fancy's filigree.
Just round the corner, on Life's street, a
little Antique Shop I know.  My heart
fares forth with quickened beat to view
the gems of Long Ago.

<i>TIME'S SACK</i>
</h3>

<p>
"OH, Father Time! what have
you there?  What's in your bag?
Now, prithee, say.  How do you know
which is my share of all those things
you hide away?  And are there pleasant
things for me?  Please, Father Time,
just one quick peep.  To-morrow's share
do let me see, before I wrap myself in
sleep."  Old Father Time said not one
word, just went a-walking down Life's
street.  It's very strange he never heard
my eager, chasing, racing feet.  And
yet next day, without a doubt, I find a
dozen things to do.  From Time's big
sack they've fallen out.  He might have
told&mdash;of course, he knew!  I'm wiser
now, I do not ask what Father Time will
bring to-morrow; for each day has its
play and task; its joy and e'en its sorrow.
And each awakening has this thrill:
I wonder what To-day will bring?
Perhaps a golden daffodil a-trumpeting,
"It's Spring!"  "It's Spring!"

THE HUMDRUM WAY
</h3>

<p>
When something unusual has to
be done, a perilous hill to be
scaled, a bridge to be crossed, a venture
begun, we think not of those who have
failed, but we tackle the job with courage
and zest, for really and truly it's fun to
feel that our strength is standing the
test when there's something of worth to
be done.  When we feel we are watched
by critical eyes, when we know there's
reward if we win, it's neither a matter for
praise nor surprise that we're only too
glad to begin; for it's human to like the
cheers and applause that follow spectacular
feats, but save a few cheers for this
other cause&mdash;for the heroes in quiet little
streets.  When the same old thing has
got to be done&mdash;a drab little, quiet little,
everyday task, a floor to be swept, a
ledger begun, then this is the boon we
justly may ask&mdash;that we may be given
the strength, day by day, to walk with
sweet grace the dull, Humdrum Way.

<i>GIFT OF GLOVES</i>
</h3>

<p>
A gift of gloves!  I must confess
no other gift can quite express, so
clearly yet so silently, a friend's most
loving thought of me (he knew my size,
how did he guess?).  It exercises
thoughtfulness, a knowledge of my style of dress,
to choose with perspicacity&mdash;a gift of
gloves!  For they must fit precisely, yes,
if they'd achieve a huge success.  The
texture, colour, must agree with other
garments worn by me, must harmonize;
well, more or less.  But here's the point
I wish to stress: it is a gift that comes to
bless, for when one dons them carefully,
a loving thought springs up, you see,
responsive to the gloves' caress.  One's
hands are clothed in friendliness and
space is bridged by gloves that press
with human warmth and gentleness.
One feels a sweet cam'raderie, if one is
wearing happily&mdash;a gift of gloves!

<i>DOGGIE&mdash;IN MEMORIAM</i>
</h3>

<p>
This doggie was young when I was
young.  We understood each other's
tongue; we understood each other's
ways, together we spent our childhood's
days.  Later, 'twas he who understood
each change of temper and of mood.
He lived to give and I to take; he
changed his ways just for my sake.  If
rest I wished, then so did he; he gave me
love and sympathy; he liked my silence,
liked my talk; was ever glad to race or
walk; to wait for me, to sit quite still,
happy and proud to do my will.  Now
that he's travelled on alone, there's
naught to do but set this stone, then
try to reach my journey's end as nobly as
this canine friend.  Oh, little pal of
childhood's days, I ought to have such
decent ways.  You did your best to
teach me, pet&mdash;and doggie, dear, I
shan't forget.

<i>WHEN IN THE DUMPS</i>
</h3>

<p>
Don't be sorry for yourself&mdash;better
smile.  Worst of troubles will
disperse&mdash;in a while.  If self-pity mounts
up high, you are bound to mope or cry,
bound to amplify your trouble, make it
grow in size, quite double, being sorry
for oneself is out of style!  Don't be
sorry for yourself&mdash;better smile;
blackest clouds will pass away&mdash;in a while.
'Tis true, you've been hard hit, not a
friend but would admit you have cause
to lose some sleep, quite a lot to make
you weep.  Don't you do it, though, for
pity's out of style!  Don't be sorry for
yourself&mdash;better smile.  Sun and moon
and stars will shine&mdash;in a while, and
self-pity doesn't pay, for it has a nasty
way of turning courage pale, and then
we're bound to fail.  So let's toss our
heads and laugh; lo! the troubles fade
to half.  Just keep smiling&mdash;for
self-pity's out of style!

"<i>FETCH THE FITTER!</i>"
</h3>

<p>
"Fetch the fitter, frock's all wrong;
sleeves too tight and waist too
low; neck line ugly; skirt too long,
worn so very short, you know.  Fetch
the fitter, please."  Fitter comes and
eyes the dress, fills her mouth with
shining pins, shows no signs of deep
distress, but her fearful task begins,
flopping on her knees.  Snips and pins
and pins and snips, stands upright and
snips some more; mutters through her
pin-filled lips: "Just twelve inches
from the floor."  Now she measures it.
Here some gathers, here a pleat; lifts a
bit and snips a bit; dress is looking now
quite neat, just a perfect fit.  Wouldn't
it be luck, indeed, when life's pattern
goes awry, when it doesn't fit the need,
we had only just to cry: "Fetch the
fitter, pray"?  Swiftly she would come
and smile (fitters always are so nice),
cut the day to beauty's style, without
grumbling, in a trice, perfect fitting day.

<i>BAGPIPES</i>

Since I have heard the great pipes
playing, not on the stage nor
crowded street, but out on a moorland
with heather swaying to the pibroch's
rhythm about our feet.  Since I have
heard the pipes thus playing&mdash;for aye in
my blood is their throb and beat.  Since
I have heard the great pipes wailing,
lamenting the death of a gallant chief
and the strength of his clan that was
slowly failing (perish the fruit and fall
the leaf).  Since I have heard the pipes
thus wailing&mdash;for aye in my heart is the
pibroch's grief.  Since I have seen a
calm loch sleeping, with starshine and
moonshine upon its breast, and heard
the pipes with sorrow weeping lamenting
a chieftain gone to his rest.  Since I have
heard the great pipes playing a summons
to war that the clans must obey, whilst
over the moorland the heather was
swaying&mdash;their throb and their beat in my
blood lives for aye.

<i>WHEN I WAS EIGHT</i>
</h3>

<p>
When I was only eight years old,
I longed to be twice ten, and wear
a frock of lace and gold to dazzle princely
men.  To marry was my great desire,
because it seemed to me, once married I
could then aspire to drink the strongest
tea!  At every meal I then would eat,
thus to myself I said, a mustard pickle
for a treat (one could when one was
wed!).  My skirts would trail along the
floor, my hair I'd pin up high and stick
in pins, at least a score; an ostrich ruff
I'd buy.  Ah, me!  How quickly years
do pass; how quickly youth has fled.
I stand before the looking-glass&mdash;no
hair-pins in my head!  No fan-shaped
combs like Mother wore, my hair is short,
you see; my skirts refuse to sweep the
floor, and I dislike strong tea!  But yet
I love to bring to mind these dreams I
had of yore.  The future looms both
bright and kind when one is two times
four.

<i>MY FATHER</i>
</h3>

<p>
My recollections are of little things!
How his two hands would flap and
soar like wings above my curly head.
Then suddenly, oh magic, great and
strange, my curls to coloured sugar-sticks
would change&mdash;at least, so Father said.
And it was true!  I'd see them tumble
out.  And only stupid grown-ups then
could doubt that Father worked a spell.
Sometimes he'd make a pistol of his
hand.  One shot, and lo! there'd fall, at
his command (this I remember well), a
thrilling secret parcelled up so tight,
right on my plate&mdash;and this in broad
daylight!  A mother's songs, and care
and romping fun, we do accept as we
accept the sun and lovely flowers that
blow.  But magic fathers!  Those who
cure all ills by hourly doses of some
spongecake pills, are marvellous to know!
There was a father much beloved by all.
To him the shy birds came; and babies
small gurgled and cooed love's sign.
These memories are now as fragrance
blown across the fields of life which he
has sown&mdash;this Father who was mine.

<i>THE HEART'S WAY</i>
</h3>

<p>
'Tis strange&mdash;but what I love the
best is not the garden at its height,
when fragrant flowers, in masses bright,
are rioting for my delight, the blue, the
red, the yellow, white&mdash;not then I love
the garden best!  But when I make a
humble quest around each pregnant
garden bed, and look for bits of blue and
red or marguerite with golden head, just
shortly after winter's sped&mdash;'tis then I
love the garden best.  For then one
greets with joyous zest a little spray of
Columbine, some Bleeding Heart to
intertwine, one Iris dressed in purple
fine; a small bouquet, but Spring's
sweet sign.  'Tis then I love the garden
best.  Or when the leaves in brown are
dressed, when many blossoms faint with
cold; but here a saffron Snap stands
bold; and here a Pansy splashed with
gold; Tobacco flowers at night unfold&mdash;'tis
then I love the garden best.

<i>LIFE IS TOO SHORT</i>
</h3>

<p>
Life is too short for sighing and
regretting.  That which is done,
we cannot now undo.  Before the sun
completes another setting, Life may have
changed its aspect and its hue.  Blunders
are never mended by mere fretting;
better to start afresh, mistakes forgetting.
Life is too short a single thing to rue.
Life is too short for bitterness and hating.
Nothing is gained by venom and despair.
'Tis not a virtue to be ever prating that
worms abide within the blossom fair.
Goodness, forsooth, is not one whit
abating, though Cynics give a jaundiced,
twisted rating.  Life is too short to
entertain dull care.  Life is just long
enough for you and me to do our work
with energy and zest.  Just long enough
for each of us to try to make of it a helpful,
joyous quest; to brighten up, perchance,
a neighbour's sky.  Too short for hate;
too short for futile sigh.  Just long
enough to learn that Love is best.

<i>POINT OF VIEW</i>

If only I could prove to you&mdash;so
much depends on point of view.  If
only I could make it clear that you are
worried by a fear!  If only I could make
you see that we are what we wish to be.
If only I could give you cause to put aside
your grief, and pause, and look within
your own sad heart&mdash;'tis there you'd
find the poisoned dart.  If only I could
make it plain that sun no better is than
rain; that there's no riches just like
health; that happiness comes not from
wealth.  If only I could make you try
to view the world with smiling eye, to
look not down but up instead; for thus
one sees the sunset red, for thus one sees
the rosy dawn, and gleaming glory of
the morn.  If only I could prove to you
that all depends on point of view&mdash;I think
you'd find life quite worth while, deserving
of your praise and smile.

<i>LIFE'S A.B.C.</i>
</h3>

<p>
Do you remember how we used to
say the A.B.C. when we were very
young?  We stood in semi-circular array,
and proved a nimbleness of brain and
tongue!  'Twas "A.B.C." right to the
final "Z," we chanted in a wailing minor
key.  One little blue-eyed girl with curly
head always stopped short each time she
reached the "D."  But patient teacher,
smiling, put her right.  Then on she'd
go quite blithely to the end.  And some
who were exceptionally bright, from
"Z" to "A" the backward trail could
wend!  But now, we often find Life goes
awry.  Its "A.B.C." is very hard to
learn.  Letters refuse, no matter how we
try, to follow smoothly, each in proper
turn.  'Tis then, like children of the
long-ago, we ask the Teacher, watching
patiently, if He will help us so that we
may know the way to read Life's puzzling
A.B.C.

She's temperate always, in all things.
She's sympathetic, strong in mind.  A

yet she has not angel's wings!  And
from her very soul there flows a vital
